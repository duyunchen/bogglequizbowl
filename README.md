Boggle Quiz Bowl

Boggle Quiz Bowl is a simple web-based minigame involving only Yes/No
answers related to words on a Boggle board. You have 7 seconds to 
answer each question and a single wrong answer ends the game! 
The remaining time on each correctly answered question is the score for that
question.

Technologies used:
HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Backbone.js, Foundation, Python, Flask, SQLite

This is an independent project to practice basic full stack web development. 
I learned a lot just by scouring the interwebs for information!  A lot of the 
code may not be up to professional coding standards since I had to piece 
together a lot of tutorials and proof-of-concept shenanigans. I will work on 
cleaning up this code for maximal maintability and hopefully add a testing 
framework. Flask has some nice tools for that. Coding is fun!  Polishing it is
less fun but satisfying in another way.
