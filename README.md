Boggle Quiz Bowl
==============

Boggle Quiz Bowl is a simple web-based minigame involving only Yes/No
answers related to words on a Boggle board. You have 7 seconds to 
answer each question and a single wrong answer ends the game! 
The remaining time on each correctly answered question is the score for that
question.

Technologies used:
HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Backbone.js, Underscore.js, Foundation, Python, Flask, SQLite

This is an independent project to practice basic full stack web development. 
I learned most of this myself by scouring the interwebs for information. Code quality not guaranteed.
