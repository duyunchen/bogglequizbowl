Boggle Quiz Bowl

Boggle Quiz Bowl is a simple minigame involving only Yes/No
answers related to words on a Boggle board. You have 7 seconds to 
answer each question and a single wrong answer ends the game! 
The remaining time on each correctly answered question is the score for that
question.

Technologies used:
HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Backbone.js, Foundation, Python, Flask, SQLite

I am using this project to practice basic full stack web development. I learned
a lot just by scouring the interwebs for information!  A lot of the code may
not be up to decent coding standards since I had to piece together a lot of 
tutorials and proof-of-concept shenanigans.  I will work on cleaning up this 
code for maintability and hopefully add a testing framework into the mix. Coding
is fun!
